## ABSTRACT
In this thesis, an extensive survey on spatiotemporal data mining networks was done, and a comparison of those network models using a fire event dataset was made. This thesis addresses two issues: 1. Among those recently proposed STDM-DL (spatial-temporal data mining, deep learning) models, how to compare those models in forecasting capability? And 2. What are the performances of those models when applied to the fire dataset from our previous search? Two experiments are performed in this thesis. The first one was that we ran the state-of-the-art STDM-DL models using their data and compared their performances. The models under this study are trained by either METR-LA or PEMS-BAY dataset, predicting the traffic in spatial and temporal domains. In the second experiment, we used the fire-call dataset of the New Taipei City (NTPC-Fire 2015-17) and implemented some familiar yet straightforward models, such as Autoencoders and GANs, to reconstruct (predict) rasterised heatmaps. Then, we processed the temporal representations using an LSTM-RNN, FBProphet, and ARIMA, to compare performance in time series forecasting of daily and weekly incident frequencies. Our first experiment discovered that some state-of-the-art models, such as ST-MetaNet, STGCN, and Spacetimeformer, all have similar performance. The “Deepforecast Multi-LSTM” is the best traffic prediction model to date. Surprisingly, in our second experiment, for our small dataset, the FBProphet model is our best temporal model with 6.97231 RMSE and 5.045342 MAE. Likewise, our best spatial model to reconstruct (predict) a raster heatmap was the 9-Batch Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with 1.04198155 RMSE and 0.3522904 MAE. Given these findings, we further use data visualisation and implement combined models and architectures for each domain in the STDM task. This study suggested that those existing models can be used to solve issues in the spatial-temporal domain, and the use of deep learning networks is a fast-growing research field that depends intensely on big data.
